Assignment2 Final report
The analysis of a dataset comprised of physiological signals and motion data obtained from a wearable device is presented in this work.
Exploratory data analysis was used to uncover the correlations between the variables after preprocessing and merging the data.
The analysis's findings showed some mild correlations between the variables, but no significant connections. For the purpose of categorising the data into two groups—normal and stressed—three machine learning models were created.
We evaluated the LSTM Neural Network, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
The LSTM Neural Network classified the physiological signals and motion data gathered from wearable devices with the highest accuracy, 81\%, and the lowest loss, $0.35$, respectively. 
These findings indicate that stress levels in people can be monitored using machine learning models, particularly LSTM neural networks.
